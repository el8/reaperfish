Reaperfish TODO's 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bugs
----
- kworker threads / pagecache IO tracking (similar to existing HV services, required to see HV services)
  -> should be "fixed" by outer bio tracing, verify
- BPF might miss some IOs coming from merge requests, see biosnoop.bpf.c: BPF_KPROBE(blk_account_io_merge_bio
  maybe add to trace_req_start()


Feats
-----
- ncurses / notcurses GUI
- different sort's like most BW
- histogram/percentiles and log mode
- document all build and run-time dependencies
- vm-mode and process-mode (default), command line switch
- topology detection & command line switches, RAID detection logic
- runnable on laptop and HVs!
- minimize golang dependecies or re-write golang in C ?
- fancy graphs


BPF
---
- decide on minimal kernel version to support, 5.10+? focal? and required dependencies (libbpf),
- improve kernel version logic in BPF code
- add BTF runtime or kernel version check
- build with uid/gid to prevent objects belonging to root?
- Try to support kernel invariants (5.4, 5.10, 5.10+)
- bi_disk is replaced by struct block_device *bi_bdev 309dca309fc39a9e3c31b916393b74bd174fd74e after 5.9
- block_bio_complete: error argument got removed, need to deal with both variants for 5.4
  commit d24de76af836260a99ca2ba281a937bd5bc55591
  Folgt auf: v5.7, Vorg√§nger von: v5.8-rc1
  block: remove the error argument to the block_bio_complete tracepoint


Long-term
---------
- QEMU tracing, attach bpf (like systemtap / uprobes) to qemu?
- Testing/Verification
  Testsuite to verify measured values against fio probe
  (more) plausibility checks at runtime (some are already in place)
