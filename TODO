Reaperfish TODO's 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- kworker threads / pagecache IO tracking (similar to existing HV services, required to see HV services)
  -> should be "fixed" by outer bio tracing, verify
- different sort's like most BW
- BPF might miss some IOs coming from merge requests, see biosnoop.bpf.c: BPF_KPROBE(blk_account_io_merge_bio
  maybe add to trace_req_start()

o Histograms
  in-kernel BPF histogram aggregation passing histogram data to user-space (keeping direct event passing as a separate option)
  histograms: not dynamic range because not comparable, buckets can be non-linear though
  latency by blocksizes

o QEMU tracing
  attach bpf (like systemtap / uprobes) to qemu?

o Testing/Verification
  Testsuite to verify measured values against fio probe
  (more) plausibility checks at runtime (some are already in place)

o upstream:
  decide on minimal kernel version to support, 5.10+? focal? and required dependencies (libbpf),
  document build and run-time dependencies
  
  improve kernel version logic in BPF code

  vm-mode and process-mode (default), command line switch

  add BTF runtime or kernel version check

  topology detection & command line switches, RAID detection logic

  runnable on laptop and HVs!

  minimize golang dependecies or re-write golang in C ?
